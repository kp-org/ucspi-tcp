Installation supplements
------------------------

Use the conf-* files in the main directory for your adjustments:

1. Plattform dependent customization
- conf-cc (don't need to be touched -- except if clang support is needed).
- conf-ld (remove option '-m64' and/or replace it with your architecure; 
           ie. installing on x86-32 needs removing this flag)

- conf-man (target for man-pages => /usr/share/man)

Note: The 32 bit version will compile and work on a RasPi 3!

2. Installation procedure
Usually, you just install the package with

- package/install

3. Individual treatment

- package/compile -- just compile
- package/man -- install man-pages
- package/upgrade -- for new versions
- package/report -- report success+sysdeps to feh@fehcom.de

4. Testing

- package/rts -- after compilation!

Note: 	This test are practically unaltered taken from ucspi-tcp-0.88. 
	However, they mainly are based on IPv6 tests.
	Execution takes some time and the results might not be meaningful.
	This is in particular true for rblsmtpd.
